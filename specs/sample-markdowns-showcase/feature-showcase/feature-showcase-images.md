## Image Syntax

```markdown
![Alt Text](image-url)
![Description](https://example.com/image.png)
```

## Obsidian-Style Editing

In **Live Preview** mode:
- When cursor is **outside** the image: Only rendered image is shown
- When cursor is **inside** the image: Both markdown syntax and rendered image are shown on separate lines
- This allows easy editing while seeing the result
